# Notebooks

Contains any Jupyter or R notebooks that you used in the course of your project should be stored here.

Keep in mind that while notebooks are great to explore your data they are challenging to track with version control systems
and present barriers to reproducibility when used haphazardly[^1].

Convert your notebook to scripts for your final product whenever feasible.

## Naming Convention
An ideal naming convention for your notebooks is `<step.number>-<initials>-<short-description>`
i.e. `1.0-rw-source-data-profiling`
