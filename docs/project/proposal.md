# Research Proposal

## Introduction and Literature Review

### Research Problem and Scope

Main topic or problem being studied and how widespread or how much of a problem it is.

### Importance or Significance

“So what?” question: Why your topic is important and what potential contribution studying it could make.

### Conceptual Framework or Theory

General background of the theory and its assumptions and relevant variables, discussion of what the framework or theory would say about your topic, and demonstration of how it relates to the hypothesis you proposed. The framework or theory should be consistent with typical epistemologies used in quantitative studies, in which there is one reality and one truth that can be known and research is used to know it.

### Previous Research

Review of previous studies, including reference to the samples and methods used across studies and, ideally, a critical and integrated review.

### Gap In the Literature

General overview of what is known about a topic, followed by a statement of what is not known and why this matters, leading to the purpose statement showing how you plan to fill the gap

### Purpose Statement

Goals or aims and general description of your study

### Research question

Basic research question and hypotheses making specific predictions about what you expect the results of your study to be. When worded correctly, the research question and hypotheses indicate the level of measurement for each variable, the type of statistical test that will be used, and sometimes the study design.

## Method

### Design

Nonequivalent groups, one-shot case study, posttest only, regression discontinuity, single subject, static group comparison, time series, true experiment (pretest–posttest or Solomon)

### Subdesign

Cross-sectional, longitudinal

### Sample Type

Cluster, convenience, multistage probability, simple random, snowball, stratified random systematic random, time–space

### Sample Description

Size and how determined, inclusion and exclusion criteria, demographics (e.g., ethnicity, gender, race, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status)

### Sampling Strategies

Recruitment procedures

### Data Collection Method

Survey, observation, secondary data, interview

### Collection Medium

How people participate throughout each part of the study; includes informed consent and other ethical practices such as debriefing

### Data Collection Techniques

Measurement (variables and scales): independent, dependent, mediator, moderator, control, descriptive; names of existing scales used, if any; scoring methods; response options; range and meaning of scores

### Quality of Data

Evidence of validity, reliability, and fairness: empirical and procedure validity indicators (e.g., internal structure, test content, response processes, relations to other measures); Cronbach’s alpha, measurement error; evidence of fairness in testing and test development

### Data Analysis

Analysis of variance, chi square, correlation, factor analysis, hierarchical linear modeling, multivariate analysis of variance, path analysis, regression (logistic, multiple, simple), structural equation modeling, t test

## Overall

### Strengths

### Weaknesses
